    <h1>Woman Called Fujiko Mine Review</h1>

    

    <p>Very very unique anime. First the artstyle is really good, rather &ldquo;sketchy&rdquo; feeling, and I love it. There&rsquo;s an interesting thing where this anime uses what feels like loading screens for transitions, odd thing that I don&rsquo;t hate. Music is mostly good but the OP just sucks. ED is good enough.
The nice artstyle is matched in quality with the storyline and characters.  This anime has such an excellent portrayal of female sexuality, one of the few times where it feels like she completely owns it and uses it to control people. This isn&rsquo;t that rare in anime, but the kicker that makes this feel so different is the lack of comedy surrounding it.
And There&rsquo;s some heavy subjects that women are unfortunately subject to and they&rsquo;re handled good here.
This is a Lupin anime and the way it integrates wider Lupin characters while also being a Fujiko Mine story first is very good. Most of them feel quite like a prequel version of their character should with one exception. Zenigata is&hellip; weird here. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s bad, but good would be overstating it. He&rsquo;s very different and I&rsquo;m fine with it.</p>
<p>Only real downside I have(other than the OP) is that the last episode goes overboard with  plot twists. Which sucks because it doesn&rsquo;t detract that much, and these twists aren&rsquo;t <em>bad</em> but it&rsquo;s still a downside that you&rsquo;ll probably realize when watching it. But that doesn&rsquo;t change my opinion that this anime is one word. Tasteful</p>
