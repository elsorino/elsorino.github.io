*This text is a work of fiction. It is to me, the most likely “source” of Christianity. I do not believe this to be accurate nor did I receive it from anywhere else. My main goal with this was to write a “historically plausible” one. It derives from the four gospels which I acknowledge were written later than Paul’s works which speak of Jesus.* 


To my friend Nicodemeus.
As requested of you, I did attend the trial of jesus. By invoking your name, I was permitted to entry and to watch it unfold
What follows therefore, is an account of the events preceding the trial, the trial itself, and events following the trial. 
One day, after Jesus had been spreading word of the coming kingdom of God, Judas had grown weary and said to him
"My lord, when will time time come for us to raise arms against Rome? Even now, around us, the children of Abraham weep for freedom"
Jesus responded "Such a time will not come by man. It will come only when the LORD demands it. An arm raised against Rome is an arm cut off"
Judas, upon hearing this grew angry and stormed away from Jesus. Hoping to force Jesus to either reveal himself as the Messiah or to die as a false one, he spoke to a local guard.
"He is planning to raise an army and calls himself the king of the Jews"
The soldier upon hearing this gathered a contigent and arrested Jesus, who was presented before Pilate.
Jesus had told Pilate that his lawyer would be coming, but after some time when no lawyer came, Pilate asked
"Where is your lawyer? It has been too long"
Jesus responded "It is no concern of mine if he is late. A late lawyer is not fit to be a lawyer"
Hearing this, Pilate was amused and spoke to one of his assistants "This one is either not guilty, or a fool who does not understand his situation"
Pilate then ordered three witnesses to be brought in. The first was a roman guard who was subsequently dismissed after confirming he did not witness Jesus at all.
The second was a temple guard who was asked "Did you see Jesus attacking moneylenders and marketplaces at the temple?"
The guard responded. "I saw only the latter. He did not strike any man, only their goods and tables."
Pilate then asked. "Why did you not catch him for this? Is attacking property permitted in your holy sites?"
The guard responded "Our duties are only for the LORDs temple and that which belongs to it, we do not protect the property of those present at the temple."
Hearing this, pilate ordered the next witness, a rabbi who was already known for making trouble against people who committed no crimes but had denounced the Sadducees. 
The Rabbi spoke up "He is planning to raise an army against Rome and against you! First he attacks the temple. How long before he attacks a centurion, or a base! He serves himself, not the Emperor or you!"
Pilate who was visibly skeptical said "You have presented no evidence of an army. And do not try to anger me by invoking loyalty. All men are loyal to themselves before they are loyal to Rome or others"
Pilate then ordered a Jewish roman soldier brought in, not a witness but as a neutral party. "What is the status of this man and why would the rabbi hate him?"
The soldier responded "He is against common jewish traditions and the faith. He baptizes and claims to forgive sins. But his crimes are only against our LORD, not against Rome."
Upon hearing this, Pilate was prepared to let Jesus leave, saying to his assistant "This is yet another religious dispute that the rabbis want me to intervene in. I have no time for pointless trials for a god that orders followers to not eat pork or to circumcise when real rebels are an issue here."
However, before he could dismiss Jesus, a loud wail was heard outside, followed by a scuffle. 
Then, to the surprise of many, Peter was brought in chained by guards, and one of the servants of Pilate had his ear cut off. 
Being brought in, Peter yelled out to Jesus "My lord! I have come to rescue you. Show them that you are truly the messiah!"
Pilate, who was about to order peter immediately executed was interrupted by Jesus who shouted "Show him mercy! I will go in his place instead"
Upon hearing this, Pilate spoke to Peter. "You have been blessed and saved by a truly selfless man. Your punishment shall be the curse of knowing you have caused his death. It will follow you far worse than any physical punishment ever could"
Upon hereing this, Peter attempted to break free but broke down yelling out "No! Take me! I am the one who has done a crime here, not him!" 
But Pilate ordered Jesus killed saying "Give him wine, and kill him quickly with a spear. Only crucify him after he is dead."
I did not witness the killing, for it took place outside the area. I did however, see Jesus body on the cross later, where above him a sign said "King of the Jews"
Shortly after this, several of the twelve most beloved disciples went to Judas and told him what had happened. Judas, upon hearing this wept and said "I have killed a selfless man. How am I to live any longer?" Following this, he went and hanged himself.
Now, one year later Nicodemous, you have surely heard rumors started by Peter. He, who is no doubt broken down by what he has caused now spreads rumors of Jesus being resurrected and of being the son of God. 
Truly, Jesus was a selfless man who is being exalted in the world to come alongside the prophets but he was no doubt not the messiah nor one who is resurrected.
In the next letter, an account of what I can gather that Jesus had said will be send. He is said to have spoken mostly about the coming kingdom of God and ordered repentance to be done by all children of Israel.
