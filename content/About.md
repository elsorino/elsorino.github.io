Iâ€™m elso, a 25 year old guy. And this is my website where I rarely post, but where you can find me nevertheless.

#### Things I Enjoy
I love Team Fortress 2. I have spent far too many hours on it, and will continue to do so, at the determent of being able to spend more time on other things I enjoy. Throughout much of my teenage years, it was the only game I played. These days, I still play a lot of it. Too much of it. You'll find me mainly in the 100 player shounic trenches community server.
But I do play other games now. My limited experience with visual novels(Sci Adv & F/SN) has been great, I enjoy Balatro and Europa Universalis IV, and I'm much more willing to play other games now.
I also really enjoy modding game consoles. Do I play them? Not a lot, but slapping a modern screen on a gameboy advance is fun to do. I am a physical hardware guy, but one concept I think people miss is that physical hardware does not physical media. I own 2 wii games on discs and much more downloaded. 

And of course, there's anime & manga. In this regard my taste is by and large in favor of going after variety rather than seeking out a specific type of anime. My favorite work in both categories is Black Jack by Osamu Tekuza, the manga is great and the OVA is incredible. If it's a larger series, I vastly prefer if it's "Loosely" connected like Gundam or Lupin III, two large franchises I enjoy because of them rarely attempting to do direct connections.(Yes I have watched UC which is connected). 
I consider myself an "incidental" mecha fan. I have zero interest in 
Other standout anime works I heavily recommend are Redline, anything by my favorite director Satoshi Kon, Kino's Journey(2003), Panty and Stocking, and Patlabor.
For manga, I have one firm recommendation in Yomawari Sensei, it is an incredible non-fiction manga that I fully believe everyone should read. It is a shame it lacks an official english release, because this would be one of the few works I would spend money on solely to support.
Other recommendations for manga are Pink(1989), Devilman(1972) and Bibliomania(2016)

#### Political views
I don't know man. Just think of me as an anti-conservative above all else. I'm probably a liberal in the global sense, but I'm not someone who thinks "the left" is evil, any disagreements with those to the left of me is purely over efficiency. I support free trade, free movement, and free people. or something like that. 
I remain heavily opposed to copyright in it's current form. It is at the least, far too long. Complete abolishment is the best, but significant reform is necessary. Patents to also be opposed, though unlike copyright I think there's a case for "some form" of patent existing is necessary. Mainly because design documents are incredibly useful! Trademark law is mostly fine. I mean I'm totally fine with buying counterfeit products, but I don't think it matters much in it remaining.
